Question 1: Duplicated Code
	Extract Method

Question 3: Feature Envy
	Move Method

Question 4: Change it into a for loop.

Question 6: Duplicated Code
In CronTabTest.java, the lines
        expectedDate.set(2011, 0, 17, 23, 0, 0); // Expected next: Monday, Jan 17th 2011, 23:00
        assertEquals(expectedDate.get(Calendar.HOUR), next.get(Calendar.HOUR));
        assertEquals(expectedDate.get(Calendar.MINUTE), next.get(Calendar.MINUTE));
        assertEquals(expectedDate.get(Calendar.YEAR), next.get(Calendar.YEAR));
        assertEquals(expectedDate.get(Calendar.MONTH), next.get(Calendar.MONTH));
        assertEquals(expectedDate.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH), next.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH)); // FAILS: is Monday, Jan 10th, 23:00
can be extracted into a method called checkDates() to remove duplicate code.
